This is my Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface that I made during the Richmond Coding Bootcamp

You can search for 4 different things in the terminal, simply type "spotify-this-song" and add a song name of your choice,
"movie-this" and a movie name of your choice, "do-what-it-says" and it will default to the song I Want it That Way and finally if you search
"concert-this" and an artists name of your choice you will get back any shows they are playing.
